# IntegrationTestsOnContainers

This is sample project built on **.NET 9**, showcasing **integration testing** with two modern approaches:

- **[Testcontainers for .NET](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-dotnet)**
- **[.NET Aspire](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/testing/overview)**

This project demonstrates how you can run integration tests either through **Testcontainers** or by using **.NET Aspire**, including containerized dependencies like databases.
